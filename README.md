# Azkar Web Application

This is a simple web application that displays morning and evening supplications (Azkar) along with information about downloading the Holy Quran. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Toggle Azkar**: You can switch between morning and evening supplications by clicking on the corresponding links in the navigation bar.
- **Display Azkar**: Azkar are fetched from a JSON file (`azkar.json`) and displayed dynamically on the page.
- **Decrement Counter**: Each supplication has a counter button that allows you to decrement the count of repetitions for that supplication.
- **Quran Information**: Information about downloading the Holy Quran, including links to download the PDF and the mobile application, is provided.
